## Special Thanks

[WulfMarius](https://github.com/WulfMarius) is the original creator of ModComponent. I am very grateful for all the contributions he made to the modding community, and I'm honored to have adopted so many of his mods. Rebuilding and improving ModComponent has been incredibly fun despite all the time it's taken. Although more than half of the code is my own now, this project would not have been possible for me without the framework he left behind.

ModComponent's Menu system was adapted from [zeobviouslyfakeacc](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc)'s [ModSettings](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings) and borrows heavily from its code base.

In addition, [zeobviouslyfakeacc](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc), [DigitalZombie](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD), and [Xpazeman](https://github.com/Xpazeman) all offered and continue to offer invaluable insights during the development of ModComponent.

I know many people might skip over this, but I hope you don't. You are so special, and I would appreciate your support. Modding takes lots of time, and I have expenses like food, internet, and rent. If you feel that I have improved your playing experience, please consider supporting me on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ds5678). Your support helps to ensure that I can continue making mods for you at the pace I am :)
