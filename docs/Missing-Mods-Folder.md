The "mods" folder in your The Long Dark installation folder is automatically created when you install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe).

So if the `Mods` folder is missing, there's a good chance you need to [[install MelonLoader|Installing MelonLoader]].

However, if you are sure that MelonLoader is installed correctly, you can simply create a new folder and name it `Mods`.
