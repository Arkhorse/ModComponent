Q: I want to help you improve your work. How can I do that?<br/>
A: There are several ways someone could help me:<br/>
- Adding and Verifying translations in any `Localization.json` file on my other projects
- Checking for compatibility with other mods
- Submitting bug reports
- Finding fixes for known bugs
- Pointing out any errors (or things that need improved) in my documentation
- Adding item spawn points to the world (more details if interested)

Q: I have a great idea for a mod, but don't have the time/skills for it. Can you make that mod for me?<br/>
A: I probably could, but my time is just as limited as anybody's and I have plenty of ideas myself. Nevertheless contact me anyway, maybe there's some coincidence and we want to build the same thing.

Q: I would like to see a specific feature in ModComponent, so I can use it in my mod. Can you do that?<br/>
A: I can't make any promises that I'll be able to implement it successfully, but I'll be very interested to hear about your idea!

Q: I have a great idea for a mod, but don't have the skills for it. Can you teach me how to do it?<br/>
A: Rather not. I'll be happy to explain how ModComponent works and how it can be used. I'll try to improve this this wiki and maybe add tutorials, if requested, but learning how to write software or using Unity is something you need to do yourself. There are plenty of tutorials and course available online and you're probably better off with those anyway.

Q: Can I link to your Github page or one of your mod's pages?<br/>
A: Yes, the more the merrier. This is all public content after all.

Q: I love your work and want to support you financially. How can I do that?<br/>
A: I would greatly appreciate your support on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ds5678).
