## Overall

ModComponent is in active development, so things are changing constantly. This page gives details on the progress of its development.

## Alcohol

Alcohol is fully functioning.

## Beds

These should work.

## Behavioral Components

These should be working, but I haven't tested all of them thoroughly. If you find a bug, let me know!

## Blueprints

The blueprint feature seems fully functional. The format for the jsons is unlikely to change unless an issue is discovered or a game update adds a new feature.

## Clothing

Clothing should be functional.

## Explosives

These are early in development.

## Food and Cookable Items

These items can used without issue.

## Gear Spawns

Gear spawns seem to be working perfect. I added a spawn tagging system to improve user control over the spawn rates. Loot table alterations are buggy; sometimes they work, sometimes not.

## JSON files

Due to unfortunate circumstances, mod components must be added outside of Unity Editor with a JSON file for each item. This will not change, but the format of these files may undergo significant changes as development progresses. 

## Liquid Items

Work great. Added ability for water containers to have random amounts.

## Implementations

These should be working fine.

## Porting Item Packs

Several Item Packs have already been ported, and others are in-progress. Most receive an upgrade whenever I port them.

## Powder Component

This is new! Items with this component can hold gunpowder.

## Rifle Component

Due to an abundance of other work, this has been marked as a low priority.

## Saving

I have not noticed any significant issues, but don't use this mod unless you're prepared for the possibility that you could lose your save.

## Skills

External skills currently have a major issue and are disabled for the time being.

## Tools

Have been programmed in and lightly tested.
