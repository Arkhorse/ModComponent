# About
This feature allows mod developers to add mouse click actions to any interactable object.

# Primary Action
The primary action key is typically the left mouse button. Hinterland uses this for almost everything. All alternative primary actions will run before the Hinterland default action.

# Secondary Action
The secondary action key is typically the right mouse button. Hinterland usually uses this for entering and exiting placement mode. All alternative secondary actions will run before the Hinterland default action.

# Tertiary Action
The tertiary action button is an addition from ModComponent. As a result, it has no default functionality from Hinterland on anything. The key for this action is set in the mod settings for ModComponent and is the middle mouse button by default.

# Example

The [Infinity Fires](https://github.com/ds5678/InfinityFires) mod relies heavily on this feature.
