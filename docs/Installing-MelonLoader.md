The [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) is required for running most (if not all) mods for The Long Dark.

So installing it is probably the first thing you want to do, when you want to use Mods with The Long Dark.
> Note: Unless there is a new patch for The Long Dark, that somehow breaks MelonLoader, you will only need to install it once.

1. If you haven't turned off sharing crash reports and analytics, launch TLD and turn these off first.
It's important! Let's not bug Hinterland with issues unless you're certain it's their fault.

2. Open a browser and  download the Mod Loader's installer: [https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)

3. Run MelonLoader.Installer.exe - doesn't matter where

4. Select the tld.exe executable in your TheLongDark install directory 
(e.g. at C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\TheLongDark)

5. Wait for the download and installation to complete!

6. Now, create a folder named "Mods" inside your TheLongDark directory (if you have run the game after installing MelonLoader, the folder will be created automatically).

7. Download any mods you want on [Xpazeman's Mod List](http://xpazeman.com/tld-mod-list/), and place the .dll files inside the Mods folder (In some cases you might need to extract the .dll from a .zip).

8. Launch TLD and enjoy your modded game :)
