# Installation

Many mods are hosted on github and the files needed for installation are found on their github page.
This tutorial will show you step-by-step how to download the files from github and put them into the correct folder.


1. Open a browser and go to the mod's github page (e.g. [https://github.com/WulfMarius/FreeLookInCars](https://github.com/WulfMarius/FreeLookInCars)) and click on the link to the releases of the mod.

Click on the file(s) to download them.<br/>
Ignore the links to download the source code, you won't need it.

   1. Click on the little triangle.
