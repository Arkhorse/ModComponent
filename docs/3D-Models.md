In order to add a new item to the game, that item needs a 3D model, so you need to either make or obtain one for your item.

# Making a 3D model

This isn't something I can or want to explain. There are lots of better resources than me on the internet. However, I would recommend that you use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for your project, especially if you're new to 3D modeling. It's free and has every feature you could possibly need. In addition, it has a very large community supporting it, so you can find numerous tutorials on using Blender from community experts. One such resource is [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewPPrice/videos).

# Obtaining a 3D model

The only alternative to making a 3D model is to obtain it from one of the many archives online. These archives often offer both free and paid models. Some free models will have licenses that make them unusable for our purposes. If a desirable free model with a good license cannot be found, most paid models offer very favorable licenses.

## File type

Unity supports a wide variety of file types, but I would recommend you get a `.blend` file if it's available. That gives you the most customizability. In fact, I personally import all my models (with other formats) into a blender project before I insert them into Unity. Some other popular formats are `.obj` and `.fbx`.

## Polygon Count

In general, you want your model to have as few polygons as possible. This improves performance especially on lower quality hardware. People don't want to use your item if it drops their framerate significantly. Some features in Blender that I really like are Decimate Geometry and Shade Smooth.

## Beauty

You want your item to be good-looking and look like it belongs in The Long Dark.

## License

I touched on this above, but your item needs its model to have a favorable license if you're going to distribute it. If this is just for personal use, then nobody will ever know/care. However, if you have any plans to distribute, the model needs a license that allows your distribution. Most model archives clearly list the model's license on its page. Some licenses which cannot be used for modding include Editorial Use licenses and Brand Use licenses.
